####  Graph based memory for mapping continuous spaces

# need to: build function for finding similar graph nodes, create threshold parameter for 
#          creating new nodes, create node structure

# node: value, links, link weights
 
# is this new value between one of our nodes? If so, strengthen weight between those nodes;
#  if not, add to graph.
